### Howdy!

I'm Krystof -
[engineer, adventurer, and all-around good guy](https://krystof.litomisky.com/about/?utm_source=krystofl_github).

I improve people's lives through applications of intelligent systems, whether that's robots or software. I've lead teams on both the business and engineering sides of innovative technology companies, including as CEO at Ecogate, where we made the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private businesses in the US.

Iâ€™m a versatile big-picture guy, and I love taking great ideas and turning them into successful products that have a positive impact. I can take charge of everything from software dev to strategy to business negotiations and copywriting while scaling up and down supporting personnel as needed to meet business goals.
